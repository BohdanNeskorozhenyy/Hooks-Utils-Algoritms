## PriorityQueue

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Insertion  | O(log n)     |
| Removal    | O(log n)     |
| Searching  | O(log n)     |

## Description

PriorityQueue is a data structure that allows for efficient retrieval of elements based on their priority. It maintains a collection of elements where each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority. PriorityQueue implementations typically use a BinaryHeap or a variant of it to achieve efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements based on their priority. PriorityQueue is commonly used in scenarios where tasks or events need to be processed based on their importance or urgency, such as job scheduling, network packet routing, and event-driven simulations. It provides a flexible and efficient way to manage tasks or events with varying priorities, allowing for optimal utilization of system resources and improved application performance.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Priority-Based Operations**: PriorityQueue provides efficient operations for adding elements with associated priorities and retrieving the highest-priority element. This allows for the quick processing of tasks or events based on their importance or urgency.

- **Flexible Priority Ordering**: PriorityQueue supports flexible priority ordering, allowing elements with different priorities to be enqueued and dequeued in the appropriate order. This ensures that high-priority tasks are processed before lower-priority ones.

- **Dynamic Size Management**: PriorityQueue dynamically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed, ensuring optimal memory usage and performance. This scalability makes it suitable for applications with varying workloads and priorities.

- **Versatile Usage**: PriorityQueue finds applications in various domains such as task scheduling, event-driven systems, and network packet routing, where efficient priority-based processing is essential for optimal system performance.

- **Underlying Data Structure**: PriorityQueue often uses a BinaryHeap or a variant thereof as its underlying data structure, providing efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements based on their priority. This ensures that PriorityQueue operations maintain their expected time complexity, even with large datasets.
