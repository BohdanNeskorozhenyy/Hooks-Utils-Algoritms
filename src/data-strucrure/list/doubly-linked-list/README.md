## Doubly linked list

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Insertion  | O(1)         |
| Removal    | O(1)         |
| Searching  | O(n)         |
| Access     | O(n)         |

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a reference to the next node and the previous node in the sequence. This allows traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions


## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Traversal**: Supports traversal in both forward and backward directions, facilitating efficient navigation through the list.

- **Dynamic Size**: Allows dynamic resizing, enabling efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position within the list.

- **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**: Inserting or deleting elements at any position typically requires only a constant number of pointer manipulations, ensuring efficient performance.

- **Memory Overhead**: Requires additional memory to store pointers to the next and previous elements, resulting in higher memory overhead compared to arrays.

- **Versatility**: Can be used to implement various data structures and algorithms, including stacks, queues, deques, and associative arrays, due to its bidirectional traversal capability.

## Usage

Doubly linked lists are commonly used in various scenarios where bidirectional traversal and efficient insertion/deletion operations are required. Some common applications include:

- **Operating Systems**: Utilized for managing data structures like file systems, task lists, and process control blocks within operating systems.

- **Text Editors**: Implemented to provide features such as undo/redo functionality, allowing users to navigate through editing history in both directions.

- **Cache Management**: Employed in cache management algorithms like LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) to organize cache contents for efficient access.

- **Memory Allocation**: Used in memory allocation algorithms (e.g., malloc/free in C) to manage free memory blocks efficiently.

- **Browser History**: Utilized by web browsers to maintain a history of visited web pages, enabling backward and forward navigation through browsing history.

- **Dequeues (Double-Ended Queues)**: Serve as the underlying data structure for implementing dequeues, supporting efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends.

- **LRU Caches**: Utilized in LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementations to maintain the order of recently accessed items for efficient eviction.

## Advantages

1. **Bidirectional Traversal**: Unlike singly linked lists, doubly linked lists support traversal in both forward and backward directions, enabling efficient navigation through the list.

2. **Dynamic Size**: Doubly linked lists allow dynamic resizing, facilitating efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position within the list.

3. **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**: Inserting or deleting elements in a doubly linked list at any position typically requires only a constant number of pointer manipulations, ensuring efficient performance.

4. **Memory Overhead**: Although doubly linked lists have a higher memory overhead compared to arrays due to additional pointers, they offer greater flexibility and efficiency in terms of dynamic resizing and element manipulation.

5. **Versatility**: Doubly linked lists can be used to implement various data structures and algorithms, including stacks, queues, deques, and associative arrays, due to their bidirectional traversal capability.

6. **Previous Pointer**: The presence of a `previous` pointer in each node allows for efficient backward traversal, which is not possible in singly linked lists without additional data structures or operations.


## Disadvantages

1. **Higher Memory Overhead**: Doubly linked lists require additional memory to store pointers to the next and previous nodes, resulting in higher memory overhead compared to arrays and singly linked lists.

2. **Complexity**: Managing the additional `prev` pointers in doubly linked lists increases the complexity of insertion, deletion, and traversal operations compared to singly linked lists.

3. **Extra Storage Overhead**: Each node in a doubly linked list requires extra storage to maintain the `prev` pointer, which can be significant for large lists containing many nodes.

4. **Pointer Manipulation**: Operations on doubly linked lists often involve more pointer manipulations compared to singly linked lists, which can impact performance in scenarios with frequent insertions and deletions.

5. **Cache Performance**: Due to their larger memory footprint and more complex traversal, doubly linked lists may exhibit poorer cache performance compared to contiguous data structures like arrays.

6. **Not Cache-Friendly**: The scattered memory layout of nodes in a doubly linked list may result in poor cache utilization, especially in scenarios where contiguous memory access is beneficial.

Despite these disadvantages, doubly linked lists remain a valuable data structure for scenarios requiring bidirectional traversal and efficient insertion/deletion operations.
