Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at an arbitrary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. BFS efficiently finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs and is commonly used for level-order traversal of trees, finding connected components in undirected graphs, and solving puzzles and games with a minimal number of moves. It utilizes a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and typically requires marking each node to avoid revisiting them.
