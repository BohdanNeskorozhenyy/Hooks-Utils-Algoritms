Insertion sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time, by comparing each new element to those already sorted. It begins with the second element, moving it past any element(s) before it that are greater, effectively inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. This process is repeated for each element in the array, gradually building up a fully sorted list. While not suitable for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity, insertion sort is efficient for small arrays and partially sorted datasets, making it a useful algorithm for certain applications.
