## Heap Sort

| Complexity | Big O       |
| -----------| ------------|
| Average | O(n log(n)) |
| Best    | O(n log(n)) |
| Worst   | O(n log(n)) |
| Space   | O(1)           |

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by first building a heap from the given array and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (for a max-heap) or minimum (for a min-heap) element from the heap and placing it at the end of the array. This process effectively sorts the array in ascending order (for max-heap) or descending order (for min-heap).
