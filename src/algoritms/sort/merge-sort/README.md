## Merge Sort

| Operation     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |

Merge Sort is a classic sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort items in an array. The algorithm splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
